# redis-rs

This is a fork of the original [redis-rs](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/redis-rs).  It is used only to test the
performance and functionality of my [tracers](https://github.com/anelson/tracers) crate.  If you're looking for a Rust
driver for Redis you should use the original, not this one.
